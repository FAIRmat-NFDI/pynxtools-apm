We have investigated the situation and were able to confirm though that a substantial number of metadata have been documented by Cameca. In addition, we have done a successful proof-of-concept to explore a route of reading several pieces of information contained in all of these binary file formats using Python.</p> <p>The main motivation for this was to explore a route that could enable automated mapping and normalizing of some of the metadata into NeXus via a simpler - programmatic approach - than having users to enter the information via e.g. electronic lab notebooks or supplementary files. The main motivation to access the binary file structure directly in contrast to using a library such as from Cern's ROOT ecosystem is that every tool which would include a ROOT-capable pynxtools-apm plugin would also have to install at least some part of the versatile but functionally rich ROOT library. This may not be appropriate though in all cases when working with already complex research data management systems which have their own dependencies and thus adding ROOT would make the testing and handling of dependencies more intricate.</p> <p>AMETEK/Cameca has inspected the situation and works on an implementation of features in AP Suite that will eventually allow users to export some of these metadata via the AMETEK/Cameca APT file format that is open-source. Alternatively, also AMETEK/Cameca's custom plugin interface is a possible avenue how metadata could be exported in the future from AMETEK/Cameca to third-party software. When these features will be available, we are happy to work on an update of pynxtools-apm and the underlying ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling library to support the community.</p>"},{"location":"reference/contextualization.html","title":"How to map pieces of information to NeXus","text":"<p>Conceptually, mapping between representations of concepts and instance data is a key tasks in information science. The plugin pynxtools-apm implements this specifically for the file and serialization formats used within the research field of atom probe tomography. The plugin offloads this code from eventually other software where NeXus is used to avoid that every user and software developer has to make individual changes in their own tools.</p> <p>Technically, instance data representing concepts within the realm of one ontology, or a semantic file format like NeXus, are considered the source (<code>src</code>). Source data are mapped on instance data representing a concept in NeXus as the target (<code>trg</code>). This mapping is only performed by pynxtools-apm, if <code>src</code> and <code>trg</code> can be transformed such that <code>src</code> and <code>trg</code> are connected via a relationship such as <code>is_equivalent</code> or <code>same_as</code> relationship. A transformation can be as simple as that an instance <code>src</code> has an elementary data type (e.g. a string or a single-precision floating point value) that is copied into an instance <code>trg</code> using the same data type. In practice, though the situation is more complex such that the mapping demands further normalization or processing. One example is when <code>src</code> represents a tilt angle with unit radiants used at the <code>src</code> side but <code>trg</code> requires that this value should be stored in degrees and maybe even promoted from single precision to double precision. In this case, the transformation is composed of a copy, a multiplication, and value promoting of the value that was read from <code>src</code>, convert from radiants to degrees, and is finally returned as value behind <code>trg</code>.</p> <p>Such transformations are configured via the respective files in the config directory of pynxtools-apm. Upon parsing, it is the set of functions in mapping_functor.py which implements the actual transformations by reading the configuration and returning the properly formatted and transformed target to successively fill the <code>template</code> dictionary variable. The name functor is used because mapping may demand to use not only a copy or data type conversion as it was explained. It is this template variable from which core functions like convert.py of the pynxtools write the actual NeXus/HDF5 file. The latter tool is also referred to as the dataconverter of pynxtools.</p> <p>The actual reading of content from file formats is implemented in the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling Python library. This project is backed by the International Field Emission Society (IFES). IFES acknowledges the project's aim to provide a single implementation of high quality and tested readers for file formats used in atom probe tomography to enable members of the community to work together instead of having to maintain a zoo of parsers.
