# AMETEK/Cameca HDF5 file format

As another example of recent modernization work within the file format landscape for atom probe, we offer a parser
that maps results from a recent work of [machine-learning-based ranging of mass spectra](https://acdc.alcf.anl.gov/mdf/detail/6114d6c9-6c76-497f-bf4b-f1033c4b1679-1.0/) onto NeXus/HDF5.
