# PoSAP (Oxford Position-Sensitive Atom Probe)

[The PoSAP instrument](https://doi.org/10.1017/S155192951700044X) was an important milestone on the journey towards modern atom probe tomography. Although, somewhat nostalgia, we would like to give exemplarily acknowledge the many ground-breaking contributions that pushed
the technique to a bread-and-butter one it is today. Therefore, we offer a Python reimplementation of the C++ PoSAP ops file format parser from [APTTools-libatomprobe](https://sourceforge.net/p/apttools/libatomprobe/ci/default/tree/). 
[Collected in 2003](https://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/2004/atom.probe.bainite.html) --- quite before the seminal papers and thoughts about doing FAIR research data management, it is noteworthy that some data from this legacy instrument are still available online.
