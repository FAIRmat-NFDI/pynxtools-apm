# Imago/AMETEK/Cameca/IVAS XML analysis file format

Imago IVAS, the forerunner software of AP Suite/IVAS stored analysis state metadata and some data in XML files with the file name extension `analysis`. As an example, we implemented a simple parser that shows how ranging definitions can be extracted from such XML files.
