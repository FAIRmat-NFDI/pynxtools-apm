# Universität Stuttgart, Inspico/(M)-TAP/APyT file formats

[The atom probe group of Prof. Guido Schmitz](https://www.imw.uni-stuttgart.de/mp/) at Universität Stuttgart performs extensive research in the field of atom probe tomography modeling, respective experimentation, and building own atom probe tomography / field-ion microscope instruments.

Activities amongst others include [Inspico](https://www.inspico.eu/), a spin-off company of the group's activities, and the open-source software [APyT](https://github.com/sebi-85/apyt) for calibrating and processing datasets from TAP-style instruments.
The open-sourcing of APyT enabled us to add a few simple parsers for the respective analysis results generated by APyT.

Appreciating this opening and contribution to the atom community, we continue to express our interest to support
the group with parsing also their formats via the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling library to participate to the German
NFDI landscape.

Feel free to [file an issue here](https://github.com/atomprobe-tc/ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling) to get in contact with us.
