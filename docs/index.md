# Documentation for pynxtools-apm

pynxtools-apm is a free and open-source data software for creating standardized semantic serializations of atom probe tomography and related field-ion microscopy data and metadata for research data management using [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/), implemented with the goal to make scientific research data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).

pynxtools-apm, which is a plugin for [pynxtools](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools), provides a tool for reading data and metadata from various proprietary and open data formats from technology partners of the
atom probe community and standardizing it such that it is compliant with the NeXus application definition [`NXapm`](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/applications/NXapm.html).

pynxtools-apm is developed both as a standalone reader and as a tool within [NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/), which is the open-source research data management platform for materials science we are developing with [FAIRmat](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat).

pynxtools-apm solves the challenge of using heterogeneous and semantically ambiguous serialization formats which is common in atom probe research. In addition, it provides an interface for writing readers for different file formats to be mapped to NeXus.

pynxtools-apm is useful for scientists from the atom probe community, for technology partners, software developers, and data providers who search for ways to make their data and metadata more completely aligned with the aims of the FAIR principles.  Specifically the tool is useful for research groups who wish to organize their research data based on an interoperable standard.
